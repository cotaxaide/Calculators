		<b>A NOTE FOR TRAINERS</b>
	<span id="tnote">
		<br />
		<br />
		There have been a few rare cases where too many accesses to the tools from the same IP address
		has caused that IP to be locked out as a way to detect and prevent possible hacking on the server.
		This has only been an issue in January when we&apos;re all in the training mode.
		Because we&apos;re on a shared managed server, We have no control over this.
		<br />
		<br />
		If you have a large class (more than about 40 people) or
		if there are other classes elsewhere training at the same time with the same IP address
		(such as a large community library network), please demonstrate the tools 
		rather than have the entire class practice at the same time and leave it as a homework exercise.

				Railroad retirement Tier 1 amounts are not handled correctly

				Tier 1 amount is included in the retirement exclusion
				which is limited to 20K/24K and should not be

				This worksheet determines the amounts that should be removed
				from the pension exclusion and calculates the amount that should be added
				as the RRB benefits line on the State Return section of TaxSlayer.

				For simplicity, it assumes all income is earned income and provides options for comparing
				tax years, filing status and number of children (or students for education credits) or
				seeing how various credits kick in for a particular year and filing status.
				The effect of combinations of credits is not considered but will, of course,
				change the results in a real tax return so you can&apos;t just add them together.

				TaxSlayer<sup>&reg;</sup> determines the taxable amount of the state tax refund based on sales tax and

				If the taxpayer made estimated payments to the state or had negative taxable
				income (may show as 0), there may be a better solution.
				This calculator includes those other comparisons
				so you don&apos;t have to do the math.
				Taxability of other refunds, such as medical repayments, are also included
				and can be quite complex when a state tax refund is also present.
