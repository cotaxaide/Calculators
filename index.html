		Most of the calculators have a year option that allows the selection of the current and three years prior. They will default to the new tax year on December first. Version changes can be seen by viewing the web page source if desired.

		<b>A NOTE FOR TRAINERS</b>
	<span id="tnote">
		<br />
		<br />
		There have been a few rare cases where too many accesses to the tools from the same IP address
		has caused that IP to be locked out as a way to detect and prevent possible hacking on the server.
		This has only been an issue in January when we&apos;re all in the training mode.
		Because we&apos;re on a shared managed server, I have no control over this.
		<br />
		<br />
		If you have a large class (more than about 40 people) or
		if there are other classes elsewhere training at the same time with the same IP address
		(such as a large community library network), please demonstrate the tools 
		rather than have the entire class practice at the same time and leave it as a homework exercise.

				There are five different ways to claim education credits,
				each with their own limits and types of expenses allowed.
				There are also different funding sources that can be used tax-free for different
				types of expenses.
				This calculator provides a way to determine which is best among the most common three
				(American Opportunity Credit, Lifetime Learning Credit, and Tuition and Fees Adjustment)
				and can determine the amount of a scholarship that can be made taxable
				to maximize the taxpayer&apos;s credit.</div>

			<div class="tool-description">
				A worksheet for Form 8606 Parts I and II for Nondeductible IRA contributions.
				It can handle up to 3 IRAs for each taxpayer and indicates the amount
				taxable for each IRA if deductions or conversions are taken from more than one

				<a href="RRB Worksheet.html">Railroad Retirement Worksheet</a></div>
			<div class="tool-description">
				Railroad retirement Tier 1 and Tier 2 amounts are not handled correctly
				on Colorado state tax returns.
				They are both included in the retirement exclusion
				which is limited to 20K/24K and should not be
				because RRB benefits are not taxable and have their own exclusion line.
				This worksheet determines the amounts that should be removed
				from the pension exclusion and calculates the amount that should be added
				as the RRB benefits line on the State Return section of TaxSlayer.
				Although designed specifically for Colorado it may work for other states
				if the problem is the same.</div>

		<div class="tool-item">
			<div class="tool-title"><img src="Images/refund.png">
				<a href="Refund Calculator.html">Refund and Recovery Calculator</a></div>
			<div class="tool-description">
				TaxSlayer determines the taxable amount of the state tax refund based on sales tax and
				comparison with the standard deduction.
				If the taxpayer made estimated payments to the state or had negative taxable
				income (may show as 0), there may be a better solution.
				This calculator includes those other comparisons
				so you don&apos;t have to do the math.
				Taxability of other refunds, such as medical repayments, are also included
				and can be quite complex when considered when state tax refund is also present.</div>
